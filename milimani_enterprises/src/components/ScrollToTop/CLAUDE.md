Fix the scroll position issue where navigating between pages maintains the previous page's scroll position instead of starting at the top of the new page.
Problem Description:
When users navigate from one page to another (e.g., from AboutUs footer to ContactUs page), the new page loads at the same scroll position as the previous page instead of automatically scrolling to the top. This happens because React Router doesn't handle scroll position reset automatically.
Solution Implementation:

Create ScrollToTop Component:

Create ScrollToTop folder inside components folder
Create ScrollToTop.jsx file inside the ScrollToTop folder
Component functionality: Automatically scroll to top (0, 0) whenever the route changes
Hook usage: Use useLocation from react-router-dom to detect route changes
Effect trigger: useEffect that runs when pathname changes
Scroll method: Use window.scrollTo(0, 0) for instant scroll to top
Component return: Return null since this is a utility component (no UI)

Integrate ScrollToTop in App.jsx:

Import: Add ScrollToTop component import to App.jsx
Placement: Insert <ScrollToTop /> component inside BrowserRouter but before Routes
Position: Should be at the top level to catch all route changes

Enhance Navigation Component Links:

Desktop navigation links: Add onClick handlers to both "Company" and "Let's Talk" links
Click handler: Add onClick={() => window.scrollTo(0, 0)} to each navigation link
Mobile menu links: Add the same scroll-to-top functionality to mobile menu items
Preserve existing: Keep all existing href attributes, styling, and hover effects
Don't break: Maintain all existing button animations and responsive behavior

Enhance Footer Component Navigation:

Page navigation: Update existing onClick handlers for Home, About Us, and Contact Us links
Enhanced handlers: Modify each navigation click to include scroll reset

Apply to all: Update all three page navigation links (Home, About Us, Contact Us)
Preserve existing: Keep all hover effects, styling, and responsive behavior

Technical Requirements:

Import statements needed:

ScrollToTop component: import { useEffect } from 'react'; and import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';
App.jsx: Add import ScrollToTop from './components/ScrollToTop/ScrollToTop';
Navigation.jsx: No new imports needed (use existing React)
Footer.jsx: No new imports needed (already has useNavigate)

Scroll behavior specifications:

Instant scroll: Use window.scrollTo(0, 0) for immediate positioning
No smooth scrolling: Instant scroll is preferred for page transitions
Coordinates: Always scroll to top-left corner (0, 0)
Timing: Execute scroll immediately on route change or link click

Testing Requirements:

Verify functionality:

Route change detection: ScrollToTop component triggers on every page navigation
Navigation links: All header navigation links scroll to top when clicked
Footer links: All footer page links scroll to top when clicked
Mobile menu: Mobile navigation also scrolls to top
Cross-page testing: Test navigation from any section of any page to any other page

Preserve existing functionality:

Navigation animations: Don't break existing hover effects, text stack animations, or arrow movements
Footer interactions: Maintain all existing hover states and responsive behavior
Mobile menu: Keep existing mobile menu open/close functionality
Route functionality: All existing routing behavior should remain intact

Performance Considerations:

Optimization:

ScrollToTop efficiency: Component should have minimal performance impact
Effect cleanup: Proper useEffect implementation without memory leaks
No conflicting scrolls: Ensure scroll-to-top doesn't conflict with any existing scroll animations
Mobile compatibility: Test smooth functionality on touch devices

Error Prevention:

Robustness:

Window availability: Ensure window object exists before calling scrollTo
Route detection: Handle all route changes including programmatic navigation
Existing animations: Don't interfere with Navigation scroll effects or other scroll-based animations
Fallback handling: Component should work even if scrollTo is not available

The result should be consistent scroll-to-top behavior across all page navigations, ensuring users always start at the top of each page regardless of where they were on the previous page. This should fix the specific issue of loading ContactUs at the footer position when navigating from AboutUs footer section.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
